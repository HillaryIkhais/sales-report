## SALES DATA ANALYSIS

## Overview
In this project, I worked with a sales dataset to clean, explore, and visualize data. I focused on identifying patterns to gain more insight on sales trends and understand business performance.

## What This Project Does

The goal of this project is to analyze sales data to understand:
1. Which products generate the most revenue
2. How sales perform across different regions
3. Monthly sales trends over time
   
These insights can help businesses make better decisions about inventory, marketing, and regional focus.

## Dataset

The sales data contains:
- **Order ID**: Unique identifier for each transaction
- **Date**: When the sale occurred
- **Product**: What was sold
- **Price**: Price per unit
- **Purchase Type**: Category of purchase
- **Manager**: Sales manager responsible
- **City**: Location of sale
- **Revenue**: Total sales amount
- **"Date**: Year, Month and Day of transaction

## Technologies
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib

## Key Insights
- Burgers contribute a significantly higher percentage of total revenue compared to others.
- Lisbon consistently outperform others in sales volume.
- Sales show noticeable trends across months, with the highest revenue in November suggesting possible seasonality.
  
## What I Learned Building This

- **Data cleaning**: Handling missing values, duplicates, and data type conversions
- **Feature engineering**: Creating new columns (Revenue, date components) from existing data
- **Pandas**: GroupBy operations, aggregations, and data manipulation
- **Matplotlib**: Creating meaningful visualizations
- **Code organization**: Separating concerns into clean, reusable modules
- **Documentation**: Writing clear docstrings and READMEs

## Ideas for Improvement

- [ ] Add correlation analysis (e.g., does price affect quantity?)
- [ ] Create a dashboard using Excel
- [ ] Add more precise statistical tests
- [ ] Explore visualizations techniques
- [ ] Include seasonal analysis (comparing Q1 vs Q2)
