## SALES DATA ANALYSIS

## Overview
This project analyzes sales data to identify top performing products, cities, managers and also tracks monthly and daily revenue over time using clear visualizatiions

## What This Project Does

It helps businesses understand their sales performance by answering questions like:
1. Which products generate the most revenue?
2. Which cities or regions perform best?
3. How do sales trend over time?
4. Are there patterns by day of week?
5. Which managers are top performers?


## Dataset

The sales data contains:
- **Order ID**: Unique identifier for each transaction
- **Date**: When the sale occurred
- **Product**: What was sold
- **Price**: Price per unit
- **Quantity**: Number of units sold
- **Purchase Type**: Category of purchase
- **Payment Method**: How customer paid
- **Manager**: Sales manager responsible
- **City**: Location of sale

## Technologies
Python | Pandas | Matplotlib


## What I Learned Building This

- **Data cleaning**: Handling missing values, duplicates, and data type conversions
- **Feature engineering**: Creating new columns (Revenue, date components) from existing data
- **Pandas**: GroupBy operations, aggregations, and data manipulation
- **Matplotlib**: Creating meaningful visualizations
- **Code organization**: Separating concerns into clean, reusable modules
- **Documentation**: Writing clear docstrings and READMEs

## Next Steps / Ideas for Improvement

- [ ] Add correlation analysis (e.g., does price affect quantity?)
- [ ] Create a dashboard using Excel
- [ ] Add more precise statistical tests
- [ ] Explore visualizations techniques
- [ ] Include seasonal analysis (comparing Q1 vs Q2)
